# wow-classic-lfg-lfr
An implementation of the LFG and LFR Protocols to enable random raiding like in retail.

We all know that its sometimes hard to find a group, thats why blizzard has one of the best ideas during Wrath of the Lich King.
They created a tool that would create perfectly balanced groups from a pool of participants that could queue from all over the world.
This worked for Raids (LFR) and Dungeons (LFG) just like it did with battlegrounds years before, it simplified grouping and made gearing much more fair and expedient. Even the travel time was cut out because you got ported in and out to were you were before, truly genius.

However soon a version of wow based on the classic experience will be released, unfortunately this version will be missing that feature, a heavy blow for convenience :(

# BUT FEAR NOT, i InsaneKane have used my beta access to create an addon that works in the classic beta already and will only be better and more used by launch !

# It allows you to queue with the press of and button and be matched with the perfect members for your group IN MOMENTS

# no more waiting for a healer in ironforge or being depressed by how sad orgrimmar looks in classic, noone exlcuding you because your gear isnt good enough, no more boredom wishing you had back pet battles, noone ragging on you because you ninjaloot all the damn time.

JUST PURE FUN

Unfortunately it does not teleport you to the dungeon entrance but it will try to put a warlock in every group that can summon you.
